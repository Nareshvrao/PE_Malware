# PE_Malware [Cloud-based PE Malware Detection API ]
 
#### OVERVIEW
The project builds a model which detect malware on MalConv architecture which is uploaded of Amazon Sagemaker to generate endpoint API.

#### Project Files

Model: Training a deep neural network based on the MalConv architecture to classify PE files as malware or benign by using a dataset EMBER-2017 v2.
Cloud: Upload the Model on the AWS Sagemaker.
Client: Detect the PE file probabilities of Malware.

#### Development 

Load the https://github.com/endgameinc/ember and build a vectored dataset from ember library. The training dataset shape is of two dimension with a shape (9000000,2381). The model is trained on multi-layer neural network with activation layer and dropout (0.4).  The batch size of 128 and epoch 1000 for few hours training on the dataset to develop the model.

#### Aws Sage Maker

Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed machine learning service. With SageMaker, data scientists and developers can quickly and easily build and train machine learning models, and then directly deploy them into a production-ready hosted environment.
We will upload the Model and weight on the AWS S3 bucket and use Amazon SageMaker to generate the endpoint [API]

#### Conclusion
Deployment of Model on AWS sage maker is efficient way of transfer the learnt machine learning model transfer for third party service.
